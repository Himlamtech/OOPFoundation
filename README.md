## ü§ù Tips for Success

### 1. **Run Every Example**

Don't just read the code - execute it and observe the output. This reinforces learning and helps you understand behavior.

### 2. **Experiment Freely**

Modify the examples to test your understanding. Try breaking things to see what happens. Learning from errors is powerful.

### 3. **Read All Documentation**

The docstrings and comments contain crucial information. They explain not just what the code does, but why it's designed that way.

### 4. **Practice Regularly**

Work through the lessons consistently. OOP concepts build on each other, so regular practice helps reinforce understanding.

### 5. **Ask "Why?"**

Don't just learn what each concept does - understand why it's useful and when to apply it.

### 6. **Build Your Own Examples**

Create your own classes and hierarchies based on things you're interested in. Personal relevance improves retention.
